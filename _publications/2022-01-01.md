<li> We use the Ascon cryptosystem to further compress the ciphertext and replace the target group element with a shorter field element. </li>
<li> We reduce the decryption cost by using an honest-but-curious intermediary Cloud based on the architecture. </li>
<li> We combine dynamic and static attributes to grant data access, unlike prior works that only considered static attributes. </li>
