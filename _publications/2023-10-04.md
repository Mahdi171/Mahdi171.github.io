<ul>
<li> Updatable SRS enables any party to join the ceremony, making it a dynamic MPC where the parties are fixed in the generation phase. </li>
<li> However, none of the subsequent works after Groth et al.’s initial work in Crypto’18 discussed the setup of their schemes in detail. </li>
<li> A zkSNARK includes three main algorithms (Setup, Prove, Verify), while updatable SNARKs have five algorithms (Setup, SRS-update, SRS-verify, Prove, Verify). </li>
<li> We discovered that two of the algorithms were missing. </li>
<li> Additionally, we designed and improved them. Also we found a mistake in Marlin SNARK. Its SRS cannot be updatable knowledge-sound, i.e., it is not extractable. We propose a fix for it. </li>
