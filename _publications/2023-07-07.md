<li> This scheme is an overlay network that improves the scalability of existing cryptocurrencies. </li>
<li> The Nirvana platform protects the anonymity of users while ensuring payment certainty. </li>
<li> Using well-known cryptographic primitives and a novel randomness-reusable threshold encryption, it balances privacy and security. </li>
<li> According to our experiments, Nirvana allows for fast (zero-confirmation) global payments with a delay of less than 1.7 seconds in a retail setting. </li>
