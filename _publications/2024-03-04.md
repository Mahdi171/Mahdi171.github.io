<ul>
<li>  In this paper, we propose a variant of the Boneh, Drijvers, and Neven BLS multi-signature scheme, suited for proof-of-stake blockchains. </li>
<li> We further simplify the scheme by one-time randomization of public keys, enhancing efficiency in aggregation and verification without needing key possession proofs. </li>
<li> This modification offers computational savings in both aggregation and verification stages by reducing the number of required exponentiations. </li>
<li> The security of proposed scheme is proven under different models and assumptions, including the Discrete Log problem for small sets and the RMSS problem for larger sets. </li>
</ul>
