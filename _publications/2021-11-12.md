<ul>
<li> We propose a framework on lifting any non-blackbox simulation extractable SNARK to blackbox simulation SANRK in the updatable SRS model. </li>
<li> This is useful when we want to model the schemes in the universal composable framework. </li>
<li> We used the traditional technique of encrypting the witness to enable extraction without the need for the proverâ€™s source code. </li>
<li> However, since we are in the updatable setting, we had to come up with an encryption scheme that enables secret and public key upgradability. </li>
</ul>
