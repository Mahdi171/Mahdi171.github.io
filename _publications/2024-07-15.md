<ul>
<li> Flagship cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum do not preserve usersâ€™ privacy. </li>
<li> Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash hide transaction details and protect the anonymity of involved parties.</li>
<li> As we have seen before in Tornado cash, such schemes fail to enforce accountability, making them a suitable platform for illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist funding.</li>
<li> A natural question then arises: how can we ensure that regulations are imposed without compromising the privacy of users?</li>
<li> We propose an advanced signature scheme that enables joint policy (both sender and receiver attributes are important) without tracing.</li>
<li> A signature is valid only if the signer knows the secret key and the policy is fulfilled.</li>
<li> Unforgeability of this signature guarantees no adversary can come up with a valid signature without satisfying both of these conditions.</li>
<li> To make these signatures compatible with Decentralized Anonymous Payments (DAP), any signature must be unlinkable from past or future signatures.</li>
</ul>
