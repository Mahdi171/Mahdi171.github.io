<ul>
<li> Structure-Preserving Signatures are compatible with Groth-Sahai proof systems due to their unique features. </li>
<li> In this paper, we fill the existing research gap and define the notion of TSPS. </li>
<li> We then propose an instantiation over a novel message space called indexed Diffie-Hellman message space. </li>
<li> We prove the security of our proposed TSPS based on a new assumption, called GPS3 against EUF-CiMA security. </li>
<li> We then discover the applications on Threshold-Issuance Anonymous Credentials. </li>
</ul>
