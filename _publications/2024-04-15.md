<ul>
<li>  In this paper, we propose a TSPS based on a standard and non-interactive assumptions called MDDH and kerMDH assumptions. </li>
<li> We answer the raised open question in the earlier TSPS paper and proposed the first TSPS for arbitrary group element messages. </li>
<li> We prove its security under a stonger unforgeability notion called T-UF-1 and adaptive adversaries.</li>
</ul>
