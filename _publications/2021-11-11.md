<ul>
<li> In this paper, we introduced the concept of attribute-based access control encryptions based on a novel constant-size attribute-based encryption scheme. </li>
<li> Access Control Encryptions enforce a policy and if the policy allows then the sender can send and the receiver can receive. </li>
