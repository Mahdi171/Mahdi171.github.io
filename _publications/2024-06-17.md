<ul>
<li> To receive and send cryptocurrencies, the users need to create a wallet. </li>
<li> Private key-based wallets, often accessed via mnemonics or hardware wallets, pose onboarding challenges, impacting blockchain adoption.</li>
<li> In this paper, we propose zkLogin, that utilizes identity tokens from OpenID Connect platforms (like Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc) for transaction authentication, allowing users to sign with their existing accounts, enhancing user experience by eliminating the need to remember new secrets.</li>
<li>  The zkLogin system ensures strong security and privacy by integrating platform-based authentication and by using zk-SNARKs, it links the connection between usersâ€™ on-chain and on-chain identities, without additional trusted entities.</li>
<li> As it is observed from Sui blockchain, zkLogin has a significant impact on increasing user onboarding in blockchain applications.</li>
