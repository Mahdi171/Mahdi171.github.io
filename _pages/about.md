I am currently a PostDoc (Part-time) at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven) working with [Prof. Bart Preneel](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/bart-preneel/). Link to my [Thesis](https://cosicdatabase.esat.kuleuven.be/backend/publications/files/these/514).

During my PhD, I have been mainly working on privacy-enhancing techniques in distributed systems, with a focus on their applications on Blockchain space. I have collaborated on multiple research papers and gained valuable experience working with global teams and leading companies. In summer 2023, I was a research intern at [Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/), cryptography team.

These days, I am primarily focused on Accountable Threshold Signatures, Traceable Secret Sharing and more efficient decentralized zk proofs verification layers.
Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or for collaboration opportunities.
