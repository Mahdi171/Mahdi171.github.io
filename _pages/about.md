I am a last year PhD student at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven) under the supervision of [Prof. Bart Preenel](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/bart-preneel/).

During my Ph.D., I have been mainly working on privacy-enhancing techniques in distributed systems, with a focus on their applications on Blockchain space. I have collaborated on multiple research papers and gained valuable experience working with global teams and leading companies. In summer 2023, I was a research intern at [Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/), cryptography team.

These days, I am primarily focused on Accountable Threshold Signatures and transparent Zero-Knowledge proofs. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or for collaboration opportunities.
