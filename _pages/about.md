I am a PhD candidate, currently a PostDoc (partial) at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven) working with [Prof. Bart Preneel](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/bart-preneel/). Link to my [Thesis](https://cosicdatabase.esat.kuleuven.be/backend/publications/files/these/514).

During my Ph.D., I have been mainly working on privacy-enhancing techniques in distributed systems, with a focus on their applications on Blockchain space. I have collaborated on multiple research papers and gained valuable experience working with global teams and leading companies. In summer 2023, I was a research intern at [Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/), cryptography team.

These days, I am primarily focused on Accountable Threshold Signatures and Zero-Knowledge proofs. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or for collaboration opportunities.
