I am currently a PostDoc (Part-time) at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven) working with [Prof. Bart Preneel](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/bart-preneel/) and co-founder and Director at [Soundness labs](https://soundness.xyz).

During my PhD, I have been mainly working on privacy-enhancing techniques in distributed systems, with a focus on their applications on Blockchain space (Link to my [Thesis](../files/thesis_final_version.pdf)). I have collaborated on multiple research papers and gained valuable experience working with global teams and leading companies. In summer 2023, I was a research intern at [Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/), cryptography team.

These days, I am primarily focused on Accountable Threshold Signatures, Traceable Secret Sharing and more efficient decentralized zk proofs verification layers.
Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or for collaboration opportunities.

<span style="color: gray;">*How to pronounce my name: First name: MAH-dee (with the emphasis on the first syllable; "MAH" as in "ma" from "mama" and "dee" as in the letter "D").
