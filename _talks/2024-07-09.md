<p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed Systems reduce the trust to single party.</li>
  <li>Privacy-Enhancing Techniques enable privacy by design.</li>
  <li>Threshold signatures tolerate some fraction of corrupted signers.</li>
  <li>SPS enables a modular framework to design complex systems more efficiently.</li>
  <li>No Threshold SPS exists.</li>
  <li>NIZK is an important privacy-enhancing tool.</li>
  <li>Pre-processing NIZKs, i.e., in the CRS model, require a trusted setup.</li>
  <li>Universal and updatable NIZKs are reducing this trust.</li>
  <li>To model these schemes in the universal composable frameworks, we need stronger notions of security such as Upd-BB-SE.</li>

</ul>

<p>Interesting Future Works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Achieve a TSPS as efficient as the initial work while as secure as the latter TSPS.</li>
  <li>Extend NI-TSPS to NI-TSPS on Equivalence-Classes [2024/625].</li>
  <li>Explore how we can achieve Accountable NI-TSPS.</li>
  <li>Achieve Upd-BB-SE with witness-succinct proofs [2024/724].</li>
  <li>Prove the Sub-ZK of existing UU-SNARKs under AGMOS [TCCâ€™23].</li>
</ul>
