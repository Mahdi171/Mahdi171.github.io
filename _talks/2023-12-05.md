I presented our work under this title at both the COSIC Seminar and the Asiacrypt'23 conference. Unfortunately, there is no recording from the conference, but you can find the COSIC seminar presentation [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQzOdGDVI7A&t=525s). The Slides can be found [here](https://iacr.org/submit/files/slides/2023/asiacrypt/asiacrypt2023/170/slides.pdf).
