<p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Threshold signatures tolerate some fraction of corrupted signers.</li>
  <li>SPS enable a modular framework to design complex systems more efficiently.</li>
  <li>No Threshold SPS exists.</li>
  <li>The first (Non-Interactive) TSPS over indexed Diffie-Hellman message spaces.</li>
  <li>A TSPS based on standard assumptions.</li>
  <li>We discussed TIAC as a primary application of this scheme. </li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting Future Works:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Achieve a TSPS as efficient as the initial work while as secure as the latter TSPS.</li>
  <li>Extend NI-TSPS to NI-TSPS on Equivalence-Classes [2024/625].</li>
  <li>How we can achieve Accountable NI-TSPS.</li>
  <li>Tightly secure TSPS.</li>
</ul>
