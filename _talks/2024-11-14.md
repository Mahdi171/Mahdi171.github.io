<ul>
  <li><strong>Web3 vs. Web2 Challenges:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Web3 has scalability and user onboarding issues compared to Web2.</li>
      <li>Limited transaction throughput in blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum compared to payment systems like Visa and Mastercard.</li>
      <li>Web3 has 100 million active crypto wallets, far fewer than billions of Web2 accounts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ethereum Rollup-Centric Roadmap:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Rollups execute transactions off-chain and post them on-chain to improve scalability.</li>
      <li>Comparison between Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups:
        <ul>
          <li>Optimistic Rollups: Simpler technology, rely on economic incentives, 1-2 weeks withdrawal period.</li>
          <li>zk-Rollups: Higher complexity, cryptographic certainty, nearly instant withdrawals.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cryptographic Tools in Blockchain:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: Verifiable Secret Sharing, Threshold Cryptography, Multi-Party Computation, Digital Signatures, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and more.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Core properties:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> An honest prover can convince a verifier.</li>
          <li><strong>Soundness:</strong> A dishonest prover cannot convince a verifier without valid proof.</li>
          <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> No information beyond proof validity is leaked.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>zk-SNARKs are a practical form of ZKPs with efficient verification and small proof size.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Applications of ZKPs in 2024:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments, DeFi, Cross-chain transfers, zkML/AI, Gaming, Identity & Wallets, and more.</li>
      <li>Specific tools and projects:
        <ul>
          <li>zkLogin: Simplifies Web3 onboarding using SNARKs combined with OAuth providers like Google and Facebook.</li>
          <li>Prover networks for verifiable computation and decentralized applications.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>zkLogin: A Case Study</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Combines OAuth with zk-SNARKs for non-custodial, privacy-preserving authentication.</li>
      <li>Uses JWT (JSON Web Token) as a key alternative, signed by providers like Google or Facebook.</li>
      <li>Offers single-click, user-friendly onboarding with invisible wallets and 2FA support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Zero-knowledge proofs are key to addressing Web3 scalability, privacy, and user experience challenges.</li>
</ul>
