<ul>
  <li>Most users access blockchains through private key-based wallets, but traditional authentication methods like mnemonics and hardware wallets can be cumbersome, making onboarding difficult.</li>
  <li>zkLogin simplifies authentication by using identity tokens from platforms like Google or Facebook.</li>
  <li>Instead of managing new secrets, users sign in with their existing accounts, while zero-knowledge proofs ensure their off-chain and on-chain identities remain hidden.</li>
  <li>Since launching on the Sui blockchain, zkLogin has processed over 4 million zkLogin-signed transactions.</li>
  <li>These transactions include around 1.5 million unique Zero-Knowledge Proofs (as of November 18, 2024), making zkLogin one of the most widely used zkApps.</li>
</ul>
